Stocks making the biggest moves in the premarket: Snowflake, Carnival, Tesla, Moderna & more

Check out the companies making headlines before the bell:Snowflake (SNOW) - Shares of Snowflake dropped more than 6% after the cloud company's shares more than doubled at its market debut on the New York Stock Exchange. The initial public offering marked the largest software debut ever. Snowflake was worth $70. 4 billion at the end of Wednesday's trading, more than five times its $12. 4 billion valuation in February. Carnival (CCL), Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH), United Airlines (UAL) - Shares of airlines and cruise operators came under pressure amid conflicting messages about the timeline of a coronavirus vaccine. President Donald Trump said late Wednesday that the U. S. could distribute a vaccine as early as October, while the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said vaccinations would be in limited quantities this year and not widely distributed for six to nine months.
