Stocks making the biggest moves in the premarket: Costco, AstraZeneca, Novavax, Harley & more

Take a look at some of the biggest movers in the premarket:Costco (COST) Â Costco reported quarterly earnings of $3. 04 per share, 20 cents a share above estimates. The warehouse retailer's revenue also beat Wall Street forecasts. Comparable-store sales rose 11. 4% compared to the 7. 8% consensus estimate of analysts polled by Refinitiv. Costco also saw digital sales jump by 91% from a year earlier. AstraZeneca (AZN) Â  AstraZeneca received partial immunity from the European Union regarding any potential liability related to its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, according to Reuters. The drugmaker is said to have received that backing due to asking a lower price for the treatment, and would only pay legal costs up to a certain threshold.
