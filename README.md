## Brief Description

The goal of this project that is going to run the whole semester is to develop an information search engine, which includes work on data collection and preparation, information querying and retrieval, and retrieval evaluation.

## Project Milestones

- [ ] Milestone 1 - **Data Collection and Preparation**. The first milestone is achieved with the preparation and characterisation of the datasets selected for the project. The datasets are the foundation for the project and the goal of the first task is to prepare and explore them. This task is heavily dependent on the datasets, which may require some extraction actions such as crawling or scraping.

- [ ] Milestone 2 - **Information Retrieval**. The second milestone is achieved with the implementation and use of an information retrieval tool on the project datasets and its exploration with free-text queries. This task makes use of state-of-the-art retrieval tools and involves the view of the datasets as collections of documents, the identification of a document model for indexing, and the design of queries to be executed on the indexed information.

- [ ] Milestone 3 - **Search System**. The third milestone is achieved with the development of the final version of the search system. This version is an improvement over the previous milestone, making use of features and techniques with the goal of improving the quality of the search results. For this milestone, we are expected to explore innovative approaches and ideas, and will heavily depend on the context and data. Additionally, an extended evaluation of the results and a comparison with the previous version of the search system is also expected.
